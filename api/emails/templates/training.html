        Hi __mentorname! <br><br>

        Your first session is your opportunity to get to know your student! If you're
        looking for ideas, here are a few good questions to get things started:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Tell me about your family?</li>
            <li>What do you like to study in school?</li>
            <li>What do you like to do?</li>
        </ul>  
        <br>
        <b>Tip:</b> After the student answers each question, answer the question yourself. 
        They are as interested to learn about you as you are about them! <br>
        After the first session, take notes on what your student would like to learn about, and 
        build upon that each week as they progress. It might take two or three sessions to 
        get them to be open, so be patient as your friendship with your mentee forms.<br><br>

        As you and your mentee progress, we will continue to support you with all kinds of 
        mentoring resources: <br>
