            Hi, __first_name, welcome to the VBB Mentoring Portal!<br><br>

            We appreciate your willingness to be a mentor and change a life! Now let's get you started!<br><br>
            
            First,  
            <a href = "https://accounts.google.com/AddSession">sign in to your new Google account by clicking here!</a>
            (if you don't signin first, the website will attempt to log you in with your current gmail 
            account, and give you errors). Your new account address is __new_email, and your temporary 
            password is __password <br><br>

            Once you have configured your Gsuite account, return to the 
            <a href = "https://portal.villagebookbuilders.org/signin">VBB Portal Signin page</a>, where
            you will see a white button for signing in. Click on that, then click on
            the __new_email option. This should allow you to continue to the dashboard, which will give you 
            access to all kinds of mentoring resources and the ability to book your mentoring session!<br><br>

            Lastly, you will see a link for the Mentor Training Module. Please complete this module 
            before your first session.  For further training, tips, news, and events please join our 
            Facebook Group here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/villagementors <br><br>
